# Speech_To_Text_Google_API

This is the code for "Convert Speech to Text in 5 lines ofÂ Code" blog posted on Medium 

Here is the link: Medium 

The blog explains the instructions to install the required libraries and run the python script. 

The script allows users to take in voice input through a microphone and transcribes it into text. The program can be terminated by saying the key words "Good bye" or "bye" 

Please see below a few examples of me trying to say "how are you", "sky is blue" and "goodbye"
